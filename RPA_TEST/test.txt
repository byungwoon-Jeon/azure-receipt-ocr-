A health checkup document may contain multiple tables across different pages, and this is normal.  
However, you must NOT treat each table or page as a separate unit.  
The entire document — including all pages and all tables — must be processed as a single analytical unit.

This document can contain two possible form types:  
- Form 84 (general form)  
- Form 85 (special form)

The document may contain only Form 84, only Form 85, both forms, or neither form.  
However, even if a form type appears multiple times across pages or tables,  
you must treat each form type as if it appears only once in the entire document.

Therefore:
- If only Form 84 is present → extract exactly one row.
- If only Form 85 is present → extract exactly one row.
- If both Form 84 and Form 85 are present → extract exactly two rows (one per form type).
- Rows must never be created per page or per table.

In other words, the number of output rows must correspond to the number of distinct form types detected in the entire document,  
NOT the number of tables or pages.
