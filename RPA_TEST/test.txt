A health examination document may contain multiple pages, and each page may appear to contain a separate table.  
However, these tables are NOT separate. They are simply different page segments of ONE single table that belongs to ONE person.

Therefore, even if multiple tables are detected across different pages,  
you must NOT treat them as separate tables and you must NOT extract them individually.

You must treat the entire document — across all pages — as ONE unified table.

table_fields must represent only this single unified table.  
table_fields.data must contain exactly ONE row, not multiple rows.

Multiple pages or multiple visual table segments do NOT indicate multiple tables.  
They are all parts of the same table for a single person.
