This document may contain health examination information for either one person or multiple persons.  
Your first task is to accurately determine whether the document contains:
- exactly ONE individual, or  
- MORE THAN ONE individual.

### Determination Rules:
- If names, dates of birth, genders, or personal identifiers differ, the document contains multiple persons.  
- If the same person’s information appears across multiple dates or multiple test entries, it is still ONE person.  
- If the determination is ambiguous or uncertain, classify the document as MULTIPLE persons for safety.

### Output Rules:

1) If the document contains EXACTLY ONE person:
   - Extract the person’s health_check_data.
   - Extract table_fields from the document.
   - If table_fields is null, empty, unreadable, or cannot be reliably interpreted,
     you MUST provide a clear fail_reason explaining why table_fields is null.
     Examples of fail_reason:
       - "table not found in document"
       - "table exists but contains no rows"
       - "table structure unreadable"
       - "table layout ambiguous"
       - "no usable table detected"
   - fail_reason must be a human-readable explanation.

2) If the document contains MORE THAN ONE person:
   - Do NOT extract any health data.
   - Set:
       health_check_data = null
       table_fields = null
       fail_reason = "multiple persons detected"
   - Under no circumstances should you produce any health data or table data.

3) The final JSON output MUST contain the following fields:
   - is_multi_person: true or false
   - health_check_data
   - table_fields
   - fail_reason

4) Never mix data from different individuals.  
5) table_fields can represent only one table. If multiple persons are detected, table_fields must always be null.  
6) If table_fields is not null, include row counts or data_length when applicable.

Be strict and consistent with these rules.
