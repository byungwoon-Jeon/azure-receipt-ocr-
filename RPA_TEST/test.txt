When determining whether the document is a "general form" (일반양식),
use the following rule:

If the document title, header, or any form name in the top section of the document
contains the word "일반" (Korean) or "General",  
then classify the document as a general form (Form 84).

The word "일반" does not need to match exactly;  
it is sufficient that the document name or form name includes it anywhere within the string.  
Partial matches such as "일반건강검진", "일반서식", or "일반양식" must also be recognized as valid.
