A health checkup document naturally contains multiple pages and multiple tables.  
It is normal for several tables to appear, and this does NOT mean the document contains multiple cases or multiple persons.

Even though multiple tables physically exist, they all belong to the same single health checkup record for one document.  
Therefore, you must NOT extract each table separately or produce one row per table or one row per page.

You must treat the entire document — including all pages and all tables — as ONE unified information source.

### Form-Type Based Extraction (Critical Rule)
This document may contain information that corresponds to two possible form types:
- Form Type 84 (general form)
- Form Type 85 (special form)

The document may contain:
- only Form 84,
- only Form 85,
- both Form 84 and Form 85,
- or neither of the two forms.

IMPORTANT:
Even if a form type appears multiple times across multiple pages or tables,  
you must extract **only ONE row per form type** for the entire document.

That means:
- If Form 84 appears multiple times → extract only ONE row for Form 84.
- If Form 85 appears multiple times → extract only ONE row for Form 85.
- If both forms appear → a maximum of TWO rows may be returned.
- If neither form appears → you may still return one row using fallback logic if appropriate.

Rows must NEVER be created per page or per table.  
Rows must ONLY be created per form type, and each form type must appear at most once in the output.

### Restrictions and Validation
table_fields.data must NOT contain multiple rows for the same form type.  
Multiple tables, repeated sections, or repeated dates do NOT justify generating extra rows.

If the table_fields.data contains multiple rows for the same form type,  
you must treat this as invalid and set table_fields = null with an appropriate fail_reason.

### Business Site ID Extraction Rule
When extracting the business_site_id, you must NEVER extract a resident registration number,  
a birthdate-based number, or any personal identification number.  
A business_site_id is an organization-level ID and must not resemble a Korean resident ID  
(13-digit format, YYMMDD patterns, or anything similar).  
If the value resembles a personal ID, treat it as invalid and set the field to null with a fail_reason.

### Document Creation Date Rule
The document contains many dates such as examination periods, test dates, or validity periods.  
These must NOT be used as the document_created_date.

You must extract the date representing when the document itself was created, issued, or generated.  
This is normally a single date, not a range.

Ignore all date ranges (e.g., “2023.01.01–2023.01.05”).

If no explicit document creation date is found,  
choose the most recent single date in the entire document as the fallback document_created_date.

### Null Table Handling Rule
If table_fields is null, empty, unreadable, or cannot be interpreted reliably,  
you MUST return table_fields = null AND provide a clear fail_reason explaining why.

Possible fail_reason examples:
- "table not found in document"
- "table structure unreadable"
- "table exists but contains no rows"
- "table layout ambiguous"
- "no valid form type detected"

### Multi-Person Detection Rule
If at any point you detect that the document contains information for multiple persons  
(such as different names, different personal identifiers, etc.),  
you must classify the document as a multi-person document and return:
- is_multi_person = true
- health_check_data = null
- table_fields = null
- fail_reason = "multiple persons detected"

Under no circumstances may you output mixed data from different individuals.
