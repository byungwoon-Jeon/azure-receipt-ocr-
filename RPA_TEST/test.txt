Before analyzing the document, you must understand the typical structure of a health examination record.

### Normal (Valid) Structure – Single Person:
A normal health examination document contains information for EXACTLY ONE person.
However, this information may span MULTIPLE PAGES.
For example:
- Page 1 may contain personal information and test summary.
- Page 2–5 may contain detailed test results.
- Page 6 may contain additional measurements.
Even if the information appears on multiple pages, it all belongs to the SAME person.

This is the normal and valid format.

### Abnormal (Invalid) Structure – Multiple Persons:
A document is considered invalid for extraction if:
- A single page contains a table listing MULTIPLE people simultaneously.
  Example: a table with several names and several sets of health results.
- Or multiple pages each contain multiple-person tables.
- Or personal identifiers clearly belong to different individuals.

In such cases, the document contains information for MORE THAN ONE person, and no data should be extracted.

### Summary:
- “One person across many pages” = VALID → extract data.
- “Many people on the same page or across multiple pages” = INVALID → return null with fail_reason: "multiple persons detected".
