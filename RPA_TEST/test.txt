Any date expressed as a range (e.g., "2023.01.01–2023.01.05") must be ignored when determining the document_created_date.

However, if no explicit single document creation/issue date can be found anywhere in the document,  
you must then fall back to the available period or range dates:  
select the most recent date, using the last (end) date of the range as the candidate document_created_date.
