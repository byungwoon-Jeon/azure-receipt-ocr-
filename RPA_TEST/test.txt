A health checkup document naturally contains multiple tables across multiple pages.  
It is normal for several tables to appear, and this does NOT mean the document contains multiple cases or multiple persons.

Even though multiple tables physically exist, they all belong to the same single health checkup record.  
Therefore, you must NOT extract each table separately or produce multiple rows of data.

You must treat the entire document — including all pages and all tables — as ONE unified information set.  
From this unified document, you must extract ONLY ONE representative row of data.

table_fields.data must always contain exactly ONE row.  
Multiple tables in the document do NOT justify generating multiple rows.  
Never create more than one row, even if multiple tables appear.

If multiple dates related to document creation appear, select only ONE representative date:  
the earliest or the first occurring date in the document.
