The document may or may not explicitly state the full legal form name.

A document may be classified as “별지 제84호서식 (General Health Checkup Result Form)”
only when one of the following sufficient conditions is satisfied.
You must evaluate these conditions at the document level, not per page.

────────────────────────────────
[Condition Group A — Explicit Identification]
The document can be classified as 별지 제84호서식 if:
- The document explicitly contains “별지 제84호서식”
AND
- The document title, header, or form name contains a keyword indicating a general health checkup,
  such as “일반”, “일반건강검진”, or equivalent expressions.

────────────────────────────────
[Condition Group B — Title + Structure Based]
If the explicit legal form name is missing, the document may still be classified as 별지 제84호서식 if:
- The document title or header contains a keyword indicating a general health checkup
  (e.g., “일반”, “일반건강검진”)
AND
- The document contains all mandatory structural elements required by the legal form, including:
  - 사업장명 (business site name)
  - 사업장관리번호 (business site management number)
  - 소재지 (address)
  - 업종 또는 업종코드
  - 검진기관명
  - 실시기간
  - 총 근로자 수 (계 / 남 / 여)
AND
- The result tables correspond to a general health checkup
  and do NOT include special health checkup hazard-specific sections.

────────────────────────────────
[Condition Group C — Structure-Only Fallback]
If neither the legal form name nor the title keywords are present,
the document may be classified as 별지 제84호서식 only if:
- All mandatory structural elements of the legal form are present (as listed above),
AND
- The overall table structure and content clearly match a general health checkup result form,
AND
- No elements specific to special health checkups (별지 제85호서식) are detected.

────────────────────────────────
[Invalid Cases]
The document must NOT be classified as 별지 제84호서식 if:
- Only the legal form number is present without any supporting title keywords or structural evidence, or
- Mandatory structural elements are missing, or
- General and special health checkup elements are mixed or ambiguous.

In such cases, the classification must be marked as undetermined or invalid,
and an appropriate failure reason must be provided.
