Always extract the “Weather” value under the column “현장기상” (Field Weather).
The “Weather” field contains words like Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, Clear, etc.
If the label “Weather” does not explicitly appear, infer it from context within “현장기상.”
If no weather information exists, output "Weather": "Not specified".
