When extracting the business_site_id, you must NEVER extract a resident registration number, birthdate-based number, or any personal identification number belonging to an individual.

The business_site_id is an organization-level identifier, not a personal identifier.  
It must not resemble a Korean resident registration number (13 digits, YYMMDD format, or any similar pattern).  
Do not output any value that follows the structure of a personal ID, birthdate, or masked personal number.

If the extracted value looks like a personal identification number, you must NOT use it.  
Instead, treat it as invalid and leave business_site_id blank or null, and explain the issue in the fail_reason.
