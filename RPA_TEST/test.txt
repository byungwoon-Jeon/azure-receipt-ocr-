This document may contain many different dates such as examination periods, test dates, measurement timestamps, or validity periods.  
These dates must NOT be used as the document_created_date.

You must identify the date that represents when the document itself was created, issued, or generated.  
This is typically a single standalone date associated with the document header, footer, or metadata section.

Do NOT confuse examination periods (date ranges), test intervals, or multi-day periods with the document creation date.  
Any date expressed as a range (e.g., "2023.01.01–2023.01.05") must be ignored for document_created_date purposes.

If no explicit document creation date is found in the document,  
you must select the most recent (latest) single date appearing in the document as the fallback document_created_date.
